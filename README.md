# 0x11. C - printf

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

Write your own printf function.

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called holberton.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project

## Authorized functions and macros

* write (man 2 write)
* malloc (man 3 malloc)
* free (man 3 free)
* va_start (man 3 va_start)
* va_end (man 3 va_end)
* va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
* va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

## Compilation

Our code will be compiled using:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c

### [0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life](./printf)
* Write a function that produces output according to a format.

### [1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't](./printf)
* Handle the following conversion specifiers:
* d
* i

### [2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel](./printf)
* Create a man page for your function.

### [3. With a face like mine, I do better in print](./printf)
* Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:
* b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary
